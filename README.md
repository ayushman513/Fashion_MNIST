# Fashion_MNIST
In this notebook, we build a simple model using Keras to classify Fashion-MNIST dataset which is a dataset of Zalando's article images. Fashion-MNIST serves as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset for benchmarking machine learning algorithms

The training set consists of 60k examples and test set consists of 10k examples. I have also created a validation set of 4K samples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes as mentioned below.

0 T-shirt/top
